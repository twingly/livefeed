This repository contains reference code and an example client that can be used for quickly testing LiveFeed v2 out.

**NOTE:** This repository is not maintained as we do not support LiveFeed v1-4 anymore.

Please consult the [latest LiveFeed documentation](https://developer.twingly.com/resources/livefeed/) for more details. You may also find the [Ruby LiveFeed client](https://github.com/twingly/twingly-search-api-ruby#blog-livefeed-api) useful.
